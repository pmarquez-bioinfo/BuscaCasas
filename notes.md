I want to create a real estate tool to help me find my dream house.
The tool should scrape real estate listings from various websites, filter them based on my preferences (like location, price range, number of bedrooms, etc.), and notify me when new listings that match my criteria are posted.
I also want the tool to provide a summary of each listing, including key features and a link to the full listing.
Additionally, I would like the tool to have a user-friendly interface where I can easily input my preferences and view the results.
Finally, I want the tool to be able to save my search history and favorite listings for future reference.
